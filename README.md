# **Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch**

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. The goal is to build a strong foundational understanding by coding the models manually while also using built-in functions for validation and benchmarking. Each implementation will be available as a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) to include visualizations and step-by-step explanations.

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Implement machine learning models from scratch to understand their mechanics.
- ✅ Use built-in functions for validation and comparison.
- ✅ Provide visualizations and step-by-step explanations in Jupyter Notebooks.
- ✅ Develop a strong mathematical and conceptual base for machine learning.
